This program has 3 executable files:
a2Part1.py - for part 1 neural network classification task
a2Part1withbiasnode.py - for part 1.2 with bias node added to the neural network in part 1
a2part1sensitivitytest.py -  for part 1.3 AIML420 Students. It's a different neural network from the two above.

#To run each of the programs, navigate to the folder where these .py files sit, then copy one of the commands below to your terminal and run it:

python3 a2Part1.py
python3 a2Part1withbiasnode.py
python3 a2Part1sensitivitytest.py

#This program uses the datafile penguins307-train.csv and penguins307-test.csv. 
#You should keep these two data files in the same folder as the python file.
